🗂️ MCP – Customer Query System

MCP (Master Customer Portal) is a lightweight query system designed to fetch customer-related information directly from an Oracle Database. The tool allows users to ask questions in natural language, which are then processed and translated into SQL queries behind the scenes. The system retrieves accurate answers based on stored customer data, helping teams quickly access the insights they need without writing SQL manually
